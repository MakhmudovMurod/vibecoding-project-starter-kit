# Universal Vibe-Coding Project Starter Kit

A lightweight, **documentation-first** template that jump-starts any new software project.  Fork it, drop in your PRDs, and let an AI coding assistant scaffold complete product docs for you.

## What’s Inside?

```
Documentation/
  ├── product-development/         # Markdown templates for Overview, Requirements, Tech-Stack, etc.
  ├── project-development-plans/   # Your own PRDs, specs, mock-ups (source material for the AI)
  ├── designs/                     # UI mockups, wireframes, style guides, brand assets
  ├── integration-docs/            # Guides for external services & APIs
  └── sample-codes/                # Snippets / reference implementations
LICENSE                            # MIT by default
start_from_this.md                 # Quick-start guide + copy-paste AI prompt
```

## Quick Start

1. **Fork** this repo to your GitHub account and open it in Cursor (or any editor with ChatGPT-style assistant).
2. Add your existing specs / PRDs to `Documentation/project-development-plans/`.
3. Add any design assets (mockups, wireframes, style guides) to `Documentation/designs/`.
4. Open `Documentation/start_from_this.md`, copy the prompt, and paste it into your AI assistant.
5. Follow the interactive flow to fill every placeholder inside `Documentation/product-development/`.
6. Commit and push your newly tailored docs. You're ready to code!

## Why Documentation First?

Writing solid docs early aligns the entire team on **vision, scope, and technical decisions**. This starter kit makes that painless by combining markdown templates with an AI-driven fill-in process.
