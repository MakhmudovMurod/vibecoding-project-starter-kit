# Design Assets

This directory stores all design resources for your project.

## What to Include Here

- **UI/UX Mockups**: Figma links, screen designs, user interface elements
- **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity sketches and wireframe diagrams
- **Style Guide**: Color palettes, typography, iconography, spacing rules
- **Brand Assets**: Logos, imagery guidelines, visual identity documents
- **Prototype Links**: URLs to interactive prototypes (InVision, Figma, etc.)

## Recommended Organization

```
designs/
├── mockups/          # High-fidelity UI designs
├── wireframes/       # Low-fidelity page structures
├── assets/           # Logo files, icons, and other visual elements
├── style-guide.md    # Design system documentation
└── prototype-links.md # Links to interactive prototypes
```

## Best Practices

1. Include version information for design files
2. Maintain a changelog for significant design updates
3. Use clear file naming conventions (e.g., `homepage-v2-desktop.png`)
4. Link to cloud storage for large design files rather than storing directly in git
5. Include notes about responsive behavior and component states

*Note: Design assets provide crucial context for developers and guide implementation decisions. They also serve as reference for the AI assistant when completing documentation.*
